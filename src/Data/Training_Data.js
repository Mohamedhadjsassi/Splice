Respect for People: Valuing employees' contributions and fostering a culture of collaboration and problem-solving. Just-in-Time Production: Delivering products or services only as they are needed, reducing inventory costs and improving responsiveness to customer demand. Quality: Striving for defect-free production by addressing root causes and implementing error-proofing measures. Visual Management: Using visual cues (e.g., kanban boards, visual controls) to monitor processes and identify issues promptly. Lean Tools and Techniques: Applying methodologies like value stream mapping, 5S (Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain), and Poka-Yoke (error-proofing) to streamline operations and enhance efficiency.
